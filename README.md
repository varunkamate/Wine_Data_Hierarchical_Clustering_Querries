# Wine_Data_Hierarchical_Clustering_Querries
Here are some attractive descriptions for your files to upload to GitHub:

### **Project Description**

This repository contains a data analysis and machine learning project focused on **wine clustering**. The project explores a dataset of various wines, performs exploratory data analysis, and applies hierarchical clustering to group wines based on their chemical properties.

---

### **`Hierarchical_clustering.ipynb`**

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the process of **hierarchical clustering**. It uses the provided wine dataset to build a hierarchy of clusters, which can be visualized with a dendrogram. The notebook explains key concepts like Agglomerative (bottom-up) and Divisive (top-down) clustering, as well as different linkage methods like single, complete, average, and Ward's method.

### **`Wine_data_querries.ipynb`**

This notebook is dedicated to the initial stages of data analysis. It handles the loading and exploration of the `wine-clustering.csv` dataset. The notebook uses libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform queries and prepare the data for the clustering task.

### **`wine-clustering.csv`**

This CSV file contains the raw dataset used for the clustering analysis. It includes various chemical attributes of wines, such as Alcohol content, Malic Acid, Ash, Magnesium, and other properties critical for the clustering algorithm.
